        <!-- Paragraph -->
        <p>As a big data analyst in Taiwan, I was awared about data can be visualize through the interactive
            art and can help people control their own life and their work more wonderful.
            
            Let me tell you a story , when I had the presentation to the customer which is well famous
            hospital in Taiwan. They wanted our team to find out the hospital shoppinger who had wasted
            our society healthcare resourse. They did not know what we were talking about at the first
            presentation due to our theoretical mathematic model. At that time, our company wants us to fix
            the project and report to the another team's manager before next presentation. Therefore I
            found out 3D network data visualization from IDA Ideas. And when we find the correct way,
            our team work in a hurry to finish the final project to the customer. In the processing, we found
            out it involved a lot of art elements inside the visualization. Our final presentation is very useful
            and visualize to our customer and further more they know what is going on in our visualization
            model berfore we explain to them and they were surprised about<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/74932457/Hospital-Shopper"
            target="_blank"> 3D visualization </a> <strong>can interactive
            with their customers</strong>. It is a very successful presentation and they were satisfied and wanted to
            have another corporation contract to our team again!</p>
